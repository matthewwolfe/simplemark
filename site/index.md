# Simplemark

Simplemark is a simple CLI tool for using markdown to generate static sites. It includes additional markdown
functionality with the ability to add `div` elements and custom attributes like `id` and `class`.

Simplemark works by mirroring a directory of Markdown files into static HTML files, and converting all links. It will
also add CSS to all your Markdown files by specifying the path to a global CSS file.
